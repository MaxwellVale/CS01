Yo Calvin,

Do I trust you? No.

Do I like you? To be determined.

Do you like me? You better...

To be completely transparent with you, I think you need to reevaluate your "windows of opportunity" and make room in your schedule to link up. I am sure that you understand how unreasonable 2:30 on a Thursday must sound to a busy man like myself. I believe you should push to get a closer date for the interview in order to satisfy an important person such as myself.
I hope you will consider this. Just kidding. You better consider this. If you are unable to make accommodations, I am going to have to call the interview off.
I bid you farewell.

Ya boi,
Shinuel!
